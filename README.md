# Simple List Web Page

This is a simple web page that allows users to create and manage a list. The project was developed as a learning exercise while following along with **Test-Driven Development with Python** by *Harry J.W. Percival* (commonly referred to as "Obey the Testing Goat").

## Features

- Add items to the list

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the list (e.g., adding/removing items).
- **Python**: Backend logic for managing the list items (if applicable).
- **Django**: Web framework used to handle server-side logic (if applicable).
- **Unit Testing**: Tests were written using the TDD methodology to ensure functionality works as expected.

## Notes

This project was created as part of a learning exercise following along with **Test-Driven Development with Python** by *Harry J.W. Percival*. The book, often referred to as "Obey the Testing Goat," emphasizes the importance of writing tests before the actual code, ensuring that every feature works as intended from the start.
